# Daily Tracking Android App - Codebase

This repository contains the auto-generated Kotlin and XML source code components for a Daily Tracking Android application. The app allows users to log various daily activities and metrics.

## Features

*   Log daily entries for:
    *   Wake up time
    *   Sleep time and quality (1-10)
    *   Study hours and subjects covered
    *   Physical training completed
    *   Meditation minutes
    *   Nutrition adherence (1-10)
    *   Digital discipline score (1-10)
    *   Energy levels throughout the day
    *   Top 3 achievements
    *   Tomorrow's priorities
*   Store data locally on the device using an SQLite database.
*   View a list of past log entries.
*   Clean, user-friendly interface based on Material Design principles.
*   Automated build process using GitHub Actions.

## Generated Components

This codebase was generated by an AI assistant and includes the following key components:

**1. Core Data Structure:**
   *   `app/src/main/java/com/example/dailytracker/model/DailyLog.kt`: Kotlin data class representing a single log entry.

**2. UI Layouts (XML):**
   *   `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`: Main screen layout with a list for logs and a Floating Action Button.
   *   `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_log_entry.xml`: Layout for the data entry form.
   *   `app/src/main/res/layout/list_item_log.xml`: Layout for a single item in the log list.

**3. Database Management:**
   *   `app/src/main/java/com/example/dailytracker/data/DatabaseHelper.kt`: SQLiteOpenHelper class for database creation, schema, and CRUD operations.

**4. Application Logic (Activities):**
   *   `app/src/main/java/com/example/dailytracker/ui/activity/MainActivity.kt`: Main activity to display logs and handle navigation.
   *   `app/src/main/java/com/example/dailytracker/ui/activity/LogEntryActivity.kt`: Activity for creating and editing log entries, including input validation and saving to the database.

**5. RecyclerView Adapter:**
   *   `app/src/main/java/com/example/dailytracker/ui/adapter/LogAdapter.kt`: Adapter to bind log data to the RecyclerView in `MainActivity`.

**6. CI/CD:**
   *   `.github/workflows/android_build.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build the debug APK.

## Using This Code

To use this generated code:

1.  **Set up Android Studio:** Ensure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed.
2.  **Create a New Project:** Start a new Android Studio project (e.g., "Empty Activity" template).
3.  **Project Configuration:**
    *   Use `com.example.dailytracker` as the package name (or update the package names in the generated Kotlin files and `AndroidManifest.xml` accordingly).
    *   Ensure Kotlin is the selected language.
4.  **Copy Files:**
    *   Copy the generated Kotlin files (`.kt`) into the appropriate directories within your Android Studio project structure (e.g., `app/src/main/java/com/example/dailytracker/...`).
    *   Copy the XML layout files (`.xml`) into the `app/src/main/res/layout/` directory.
    *   Copy the `.github/workflows/android_build.yml` file into your project's `.github/workflows/` directory if you intend to use GitHub Actions.
5.  **Dependencies:** You will likely need to add dependencies for Material Design components and RecyclerView if they are not already included in your new project template. Add these to your `app/build.gradle` file:
    ```gradle
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.10.0' // Or latest version
    implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.3.1' // Or latest version
    implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.12.0' // Or latest version
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1' // Or latest version
    implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4' // If using ConstraintLayout
    ```
6.  **AndroidManifest.xml:**
    *   Declare `LogEntryActivity` in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
      ```xml
      <activity android:name=".ui.activity.LogEntryActivity" />
      ```
    *   Ensure `MainActivity` is set as the launcher activity.
7.  **Build and Run:** Sync your Gradle files, then build and run the application on an emulator or physical device.

## GitHub Actions Build

The included `.github/workflows/android_build.yml` file will attempt to build a debug APK of the application whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch or a pull request is made to `main`. The generated APK will be available as an artifact in the GitHub Actions run summary.
For this to work, the project must be a complete Android project with a `gradlew` wrapper and configured `build.gradle` files.

## Disclaimer

This code was generated by an AI assistant (Jules). While it aims to provide a functional starting point, it may require further development, testing, and refinement to become a production-ready application. UI/UX can be further enhanced, and more robust error handling and edge case management might be necessary.
